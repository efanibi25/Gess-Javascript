# Running/Install

## 1 Get redis
```
You'll need an instance of redis on the server/local machine 

Easiest way to do this is to install via docker

```

## 2 install modules


```
npm install
```

## 3 install concurrently globall


```
npm install -g concurrently

```

## 4 run script 
```
run ./start.sh
Note: You can use the second line instead if your using a non docker version of redis

```
