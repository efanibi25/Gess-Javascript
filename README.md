# Future Updates
The UI is very simple at the moment

I would like to upgrade it to a more modern look with react or another front-end frame work
Phaser also handles the front-end so the challenge is figuring out how to integrate it

# Running/Install

## 1 Get redis
```
You'll need an instance of redis on the server/local machine 

Easiest way to do this is to install via docker

```

## 2 install modules


```
npm install
```

## 3 install concurrently globally


```
npm install -g concurrently

```

## 4 run script 
```
run ./start.sh
Note: You can use the second line instead if your using a non docker version of redis

```
